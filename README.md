## 🎮 Ultimate Edition Features

### 🛡️ Vim Aura
Play efficiently to trigger your **Aura**. Using counts (e.g., `5j`) or search motions instead of repetitive keys will cause your character to glow with a pulsating blue energy.

### 🍱 Register-Based Inventory
Items aren't just "picked up"—they are **Yanked** (`"ay`) into specific Vim registers. You must keep the right keys in the right registers and **Put** (`p`) them into locks to progress.

### 👾 REGEX Boss Combat
Encounter "Corrupted Binary" bosses. They are immune to standard attacks and can only be purged by entering command mode and typing precise search-and-replace strings like `:%s/virus/data/g`.

### 🔊 Tactile Soundscapes
Visual ASCII **[CLACK]** and **[TICK]** bubbles appear on-screen as you type, providing an satisfying arcade-like response to your command sequences.

## 🎨 Professional Aesthetics
The game features a custom theme inspired by **Tokyonight**, utilizing Sky Blue, Vibrant Purple, and Emerald accents to create a world-class terminal environment.
